A neural network designed to integrate with scikitlearn's sklearn python package.

is fully numpy-vectorized and has been profiled to ship key components to
openmp-optimized f90 code

supports online learning.

Basic usage:
import nnetwork as NN

n = NN.NeuarlNetwork(design=[8,8]) # a NN with two hidden layers of 8 neurons each
n.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
pred = n.predict(Xtest)
